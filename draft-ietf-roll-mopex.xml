          The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) can have
          different modes of operation (MOP) to allow nodes to agree on the
          basic primitives that must be supported to join a network.  The MOP
          field defined in RFC6550 is fast depleting.  This document specifies
          an extended MOP option for future use.

    <section title="Introduction">
        <t>
            RPL <xref target="RFC6550"/> specifies a proactive distance-vector
            based routing scheme. The protocol creates a DAG-like structure
            that operates with a given "Mode of Operation" (MOP) determining the
            minimum and mandatory set of primitives to be supported by all the
            participating nodes.
        </t>
        <t>
            MOP as per <xref target="RFC6550"/> is a 3-bit value carried in DIO
            messages and is specific to the RPL Instance. The recipient of the
            DIO message can join the specified network as a router only when it
            can support the primitives as required by the mode of operation
            value. For example, in the case of MOP=3 (Storing MOP with multicast
            support), the nodes can join the network as routers only when they
            can handle the DAO advertisements from the peers and manage routing
            tables. The 3-bit value is fast depleting and requires
            replenishment. This document introduces a mechanism to extend the mode
            of operation values.
        </t>
        <t>
            This document further extends the RPL Control Option syntax to
            handle generic flags. The primary aim of these flags is to define
            the behavior of a node not supporting the given control type. If a
            node does not support a given RPL Control Option, there are following
            possibilities:
            <list>
                <t> Strip off the option </t>
                <t> Copy the option as-is </t>
                <t> Ignore the message containing this option </t>
                <t> Let the node join in only as a leaf to this parent </t>

            This document assigns MOP value 7 to be used as an

        <t>
            The Option Length value MUST be less than or equal to 2. An Option
            Length value of zero is invalid and the implementation MUST
            silently ignore the DIO on receiving a value of zero. Section 6.7.1
			of <xref target="RFC6550"/> explains how to interpret Option Length
			and subsequent Option Data (which is MOPex-value in this context).
        </t>
        <section title="Handling MOPex">
            <t>
                The MOPex option MUST be used only if the DIO MOP is 7. If
                the DIO MOP is 7 and if the MOPex option is not present or invalid
                then the DIO MUST be silently ignored. If the DIO MOP is
                less than 7 then MOPex MUST NOT be used. In case the base
                MOP is 7 and if the MOPex option is present, then the
                implementation MUST use the MOPex value.
            </t>
            <t>
                Note that <xref target="RFC6550"/> allows a node that does not
                support the received MOP to still join the network as a leaf
				node. This semantics continues to be true even in the case of MOPex.
                All the general assumptions that are applicable in the context
                of MOP are applicable in the context of MOPex as well.

        <section title="Use of values 0-6 in the MOPex option">
            <t>
                The MOPex option should also be used for existing MOP values
                0-6. The use of current MOPs (values 0 to 6) in MOPex indicates
				that the MOP might be supported with an extended set of semantics e.g.,
				the capability options <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-capabilities"/>.

                    Option Type: 8-bit identifier of the type of option. The

    <section anchor="imp-con" title="Implementation Considerations">
        <t>
            In <xref target = "RFC6550" />, it was possible to discard an
            unsupported MOP just by inspecting the DIO base object. With the extensions in this
            document, the MOPex is in a control message option and thus
            discarding of the DIO message can only happen after inspecting the
            message options.
        </t>
		<t>
            An implementation should carefully set the Option Flags considering
			implications of nodes not supporting the corresponding Option Type.
			<t>
                Unsetting the 'J' flag means that a node receiving an
                unsupported Option Type would be allowed to join as a RPL
                router. Thus the implementation should carefully consider the
                implications of such a node joining the network as a RPL router.
			</t>
			<t>
                Setting the 'C' (Copy) bit should be carefully considered since
                the node would copy the Option of its preferred parent whose DIO
                it has accepted from the set of parent nodes.

        <t>
            The options defined in this document are carried in the base
            message objects as defined in <xref target = "RFC6550" />. The RPL
            control message options are protected by the same security
            mechanisms that protect the base messages. As such, the Security Consideration in [RFC6550] apply.
        </t>
        <t>
            The use of MOP 7 can reveal that the node has been upgraded or is
            running a old feature set. This document assumes that the base
            messages that carry these options are protected by RPL security
            mechanisms and thus are not visible to a malicious node.

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
