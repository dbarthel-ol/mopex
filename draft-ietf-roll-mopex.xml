          The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) can have
          different modes of operation (MOP) to allow nodes to agree on the
          basic primitives that must be supported to join a network.  The MOP
          field defined in RFC6550 is fast depleting.  This document specifies
          an extended MOP option for future use.

    <section title="Introduction">
        <t>
            RPL <xref target="RFC6550"/> specifies a proactive distance-vector
            based routing scheme. The protocol creates a DAG-like structure
            that operates with a given "Mode of Operation" (MOP) determining the
            minimum and mandatory set of primitives to be supported by all the
            participating nodes.
        </t>
        <t>
            MOP as per <xref target="RFC6550"/> is a 3-bit value carried in DIO
            messages and is specific to the RPL Instance. The recipient of the
            DIO message can join the specified network as a router only when it
            can support the primitives as required by the mode of operation
            value. For example, in the case of MOP=3 (Storing MOP with multicast
            support), the nodes can join the network as routers only when they
            can handle the DAO advertisements from the peers and manage routing
            tables. The 3-bit value is fast depleting and requires
            replenishment. This document introduces a mechanism to extend the mode
            of operation values.
        </t>
        <t>
            This document further extends the RPL Control Option syntax to
            handle generic flags. The primary aim of these flags is to define
            the behavior of a node not supporting the given control type. If a
            node does not support a given RPL Control Option, there are following
            possibilities:
            <list>
                <t> Strip off the option </t>
                <t> Copy the option as-is </t>
                <t> Ignore the message containing this option </t>
                <t> Let the node join in only as a 6LN to this parent </t>
            </list>

					MOP extension. The 3-bits MOP as defined in [RFC6550] is

                    Backwards compatibility. The new options and new fields in

                    are nodes that support old MOPs they could still operate
                    in their RPL Instances.

            This document assigns MOP value 7 to be used as an
            extender <xref target="IANA"/>. DIO messages with an MOP value of 7 MUST refer to the
            Extended MOP (MOPex) option in the DIO message.

        <t>
            The Option Length value MUST be less than or equal to 2. An Option
            Length value of zero is invalid and the implementation MUST
            silently ignore the DIO on receiving a value of zero.
        </t>
        <section title="Handling MOPex">
            <t>
                The MOPex option MUST be used only if the base DIO MOP is 7. If
                the base DIO MOP is 7 and if the MOPex option is not present
                then the DIO MUST be silently ignored. If the base DIO MOP is
                less than 7 then MOPex MUST NOT be used. In case the base
                MOP is 7 and if the MOPex option is present, then the
                implementation MUST use the final MOP value from the MOPex.
            </t>
            <t>
                Note that <xref target="RFC6550"/> allows a node that does not
                support the received MOP to still join the network as a leaf
                node. This semantics continues to be true even in the case of MOPex.

        </section>
        <section title="Use of values 0-6 in the MOPex option">
            <t>
                The MOPex option could also be allowed to re-use the values
                0-6, which have been used for MOP so far.  The use of current
                MOPs in MOPex indicates that the MOP is supported with an extended
                set of semantics e.g., the capability options <xref
                    target="I-D.ietf-roll-capabilities"/>.

            The new fields in the Extended RPL Option are specified as follows:
            <list>
                <t>
                    'X' bit in Option Type: Value 1 indicates that this is an
                    extended option. If the 'X' flag is set, a 1-byte Option
                    Flags field follows the Option Length field.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Option Length: 8-bit unsigned integer, representing the
                    length in octets of the option, not including the Option
                    Type and Length fields. Option Flags and variable length
                    Option Data fields are included in the length.
                </t>
                <t>
                    'J' (Join) bit in Option Flags: A node MUST join only as a
                    6LN if the Option Type is not understood.
                </t>
                <t>
                    'C' (Copy) bit in Option Flags: A node that does not
                    understand the Option Type MUST copy the Option while
                    generating the corresponding message. E.g., if a 6LR
                    receives a DIO message with an unknown Option with 'C' bit
                    set and if the 6LR chooses to accept this node as the
                    preferred parent then the node must copy this option in the
                    subsequent DIO message it generates. Alternatively, if the
                    'C' flag is unset the node MUST strip off the option and
                    process the message.
                </t>
                <t>
                    'I' (Ignore) bit in Option Flags: A node that does not
                    understand the Option Type MUST ignore this whole message if
                    the 'I' bit is set. If the 'I' bit is set then the value of 'J'
                    and 'C' bits are irrelevant and the message MUST be ignored.
                </t>
            </list>
        </t>
        <t>
            Note that this format does not deprecate the previous format, it
            simply extends it. The new format is applicable only when the most significant bit (MSB)
            ('X' flag) of the Option Type is set. Option Type 0x80 to 0xFF are
            thus applicable only as extended options.

            In <xref target = "RFC6550" />, it was possible to discard an

        <section title="New Registry for MOPex-value">
            <t>
                IANA is requested to create a registry for the
				MOPex-value <xref target="ext_mop"/>. This registry should be located in
                the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) group.  New MOPex values may be allocated only by an IETF
                review. Currently no values are defined by this document. Each
                value is tracked with the following qualities:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>MOPex value</t>
                    <t>Description</t>
                    <t>Reference</t>
                </list>
            </t>

        <section title="Change in RPL Control Option field">
            <t>
                <xref target="ext-opts"/> of this document specifies MSB of the
                RPL Control Option to be used as a bit to indicate RPL Extended
                Control Options.
            </t>
            <t>
                IANA is requested to reduce the unassigned values range from
                0x10 to 0x7f for RPL Control Options.
            </t>
            <t>
                IANA is requested to create a new registry for RPL Extended
                Control Options indicating values 0x80 to 0xff. New values may
                be allocated only by an IETF Review. Each value is tracked with
                the following qualities:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>Value</t>
                    <t>Meaning</t>
                    <t>Defining RFC</t>
                </list>
                The value could be in the range of 0x80 to 0xff.

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
        <t>
            The options defined in this document are carried in the base
            message objects as defined in <xref target = "RFC6550" />. The RPL
            control message options are protected by the same security
            mechanisms that protect the base messages. As such, the Security Consideration in [RFC6550] apply.
        </t>
        <t>
            Capabilities flag can reveal that the node has been upgraded or is
            running a old feature set. This document assumes that the base
            messages that carry these options are protected by RPL security
            mechanisms and thus are not visible to a malicious node.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
